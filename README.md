This is for "Web" builds of "Paddles, Balls, Blocks, Walls", a breakout clone I'm working on. The repository with Godot engine project can be found here :

This web build is highly experimental and I'm not currently testing the functionality before I deploy it here, but please report any bugs you find to the main repository.  Thanks!
